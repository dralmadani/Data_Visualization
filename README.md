## Data


The data I propose to visualize for my project is about [the Largest Cities population in US 2020](https://gist.github.com/dralmadani/c04f95746e2f36b040d3d764ab7b9c62)
Originally published at [World Population Review](https://worldpopulationreview.com/us-cities)


#### The attribute
 1- Rank
<br> 2- City
<br> 3- State
<br> 4- usps: the Abbreviation for state
<br> 5- pop2020: the population in 2020
<br> 6- pop2010: the population in 2010
<br> 7- change: the percentage between 2020 and 2010
<br> 8- density: the density in each city (Km square)
<br> 9- aland: the area for each city (Km square)

## Prototypes

I’ve created a proof of concept visualization of this data. It's a ... and it shows ...

](https://vizhub.com/dralmadani/d811f91dafdb465887040da5445d2a41?file=viz.js)

In the second visualization, I choose the top 10 ranks  to show  the population

In the third visualization, I created a menu to let the user choose the available years, density and land area

1st draft for Cities on the world map, later will improve to be on the USA map only

Cities on the USA map

enjoy looking at this graph :)

This visualization focuses on
- City
- State
- population 2010: the population in 2020
- population 2020: the population in 2020
- Density and Area

## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

  * What are the top 200 largest cities in the USA in 2020 by population?
  * What are the top ten largest cities in the US by population in 2020 by population?
  * What are the top ten largest cities in the US by population in 2020 by density?
  * What are the top ten largest cities in the US by population in 2020 by area?
  * Which state has the largest cities?
  * How many large cities population in each state?

<br>This is the first sketching about my project and I hope those sketches drive the visualization.

<br>
General visualization for top cities by population then top states having those cities

<br>
Tring to show city name and population also, places in the USA map

## Open Questions


  - I'm not sure where to get the geographic shapes to build a map from this data
  - I'm not sure how to get movement visualization to show the difference between the population from 2010 to 2020 for each city
